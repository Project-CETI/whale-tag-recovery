// This example uses the DMA to capture many samples from the ADC.
//
// - We are putting the ADC in free-running capture mode at 0.5 Msps
//
// - A DMA channel will be attached to the ADC sample FIFO
//
// - Configure the ADC to right-shift samples to 8 bits of significance, so we
//   can DMA into a byte buffer
//
// This could be extended to use the ADC's round robin feature to sample two
// channels concurrently at 0.25 Msps each.
//
// It would be nice to have some analog samples to measure! This example also
// drives waves out through a 5-bit resistor DAC, as found on the reference
// VGA board. If you have that board, you can take an M-F jumper wire from
// GPIO 26 to the Green pin on the VGA connector (top row, next-but-rightmost
// hole). Or you can ignore that part of the code and connect your own signal
// to the ADC input.
